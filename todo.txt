- check documentation to remove mentions of insert without the naming
  modifier

- remove test is_valid_range_bounds and use the same one the module
  uses

- write more tests for more complicated functions

- write docs for everything again

- add issues to github for all the caveats
- review caveats again

- remove all unwraps from examples

- refactor tests with a bunch of next()s into using collect for
  assert_eq

- copy map to set again

- add a copy-paste notes to functions returning a TryFromBoundsError
  to foward them to:
- add a centralized section showing examples for TryFromBoundsErrors
  for the functions that can give them, possibly on the
  TryFromBoundsError page in the docs.

- write something somewhere about wrapper types for RangeBoundsMap
  that can simplify function signatures due to known invariants. For
  example a wrapper for using K=std::ops::Range which simplifies a LOT

- take a look around idiomatic rust for a bit first
- review method parameter names for all public functions

- use it in robot_Sweet_graph for a bit before publishing

#frequent
- update lines of code figures on docs
- copy readme to lib.rs docs again
- run and fix cargo clippy

- PUBLISH

- add links to [`RangeBoundsSet`] and map after docs.rs is live with
  the docs, and generally check for dead links on docs and readme

- tell people in issues of other rangemap libraries about my library
  stonks advertising
