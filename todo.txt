- remove test is_valid_range_bounds and use the same one the module uses

- write more mass tests for touches()

- change all the tests to use map not set

- write more tests for more complicated functions
- test for atomnicity, if it fails it shouldn't affect the map

- write docs for undocced things

- add issues to github for all the caveats
- review caveats again

- copy map to set again

- write something somewhere about wrapper types for RangeBoundsMap
  that can simplify function signatures due to known invariants. For
  example a wrapper for using K=std::ops::Range which simplifies a LOT

- take a look around idiomatic rust for a bit first
- review method parameter names for all public functions

- use it in robot_Sweet_graph for a bit before publishing

#frequent
- update lines of code figures on docs
- copy readme to lib.rs docs again
- run and fix cargo clippy

- PUBLISH

- add links to [`RangeBoundsSet`] and map after docs.rs is live with
  the docs, and generally check for dead links on docs and readme

- tell people in issues of other rangemap libraries about my library
  stonks advertising
