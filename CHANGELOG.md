## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a missing implementation of `DiscreteFinite` for `usize`, #54
- Added implementations for:
  - `From<InclusiveInterval> for std::ops::Range`
  - `From<std::ops::Range> for InclusiveInterval`
  - `From<InclusiveInterval> for std::ops::RangeInclusive`
  - `From<std::ops::RangeInclusive> for InclusiveInterval`

### Changed

- `InclusiveInterval` has now been given generic constructors and proper
  documentation for use by end-users, #56
- `insert_overwrite()` now returns the cut entries, #51

### Fixed

- The now generic constructors for `InclusiveInterval` will all now panic on
  creation of an invalid interval to propagate errors earlier in users' code for
  a better debugging experience.
- Documentation has been heavily worked to make it better and more up to date
  with more examples
