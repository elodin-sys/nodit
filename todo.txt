# refactor
- change <0> to use None::<[_;0]>
- try and fix all the uses of cloned() in the library
- replace MultiBounds::* with mee() and mii()

# features
- RangeMap, RangeSet, RangeInclusiveMap...
- add coalesce if same-value otherwise overwrite) function to make
  finally make range_bounds_map a superset of rangemap

# docs
- write something somewhere about wrapper types for RangeBoundsMap
  that can simplify function signatures due to known invariants. For
  example a wrapper for using K=std::ops::Range which simplifies a LOT
  probaly in caveats + github issue
- write docs for undocced things

# time based
- use it in robot_Sweet_graph for a bit before publishing

# final checks
- remove most rustfmt::skips and cargo fmt
- check toml meta-data, github meta-data and readme opener
- copy map to set again
- copy readme to lib.rs docs again
- take a look around idiomatic rust for a bit first
- review method parameter names for all public functions
- update lines of code figures on docs
- add issues to github for all the caveats
- review caveats again
- run and fix cargo clippy

- PUBLISH

# after publish tasks
- add links to [`RangeBoundsSet`] and map after docs.rs is live with
  the docs, and generally check for dead links on docs and readme
- tell people in issues of other rangemap libraries about my library
